        <h2>Mobile Phone Alert Application</h2>
        <p>My name is Marius Paulikas and I had the pleasure meeting some of you during the Kent State Innov8athon weekend some weeks back.  I had an idea for a smartphone application that was pitched to the large group, but I wanted to assemble visual illustrations and various resources to better explain the concept. I am attaching two documents; one describes the idea in detail, and the second features visual illustration figures for your reference. Please <a href="mailto:mpaulika@kent.edu">contact me</a> if there are any questions or comments; I look forward to working with you folks soon.</p>
